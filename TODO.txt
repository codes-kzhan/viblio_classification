TODO:

1. Make a lower resolution (~150 pixels wide or so) version of each
frame, and store it for MTurk use.

2. Integrate the MTurk code into master.

4. Build a library of HDF / text file for negative set training.
   * Assign a video unique key to each video here so we can avoid training and testing on the same video

5. Add partitioning of 80/20 MTurk videos for the activity A into a
training set and a testing set.

6. Generate a report that shows false positives with high confidence,
and true negatives with low confidence.

7. Detail how exactly we can get the ROC curves and histograms.
